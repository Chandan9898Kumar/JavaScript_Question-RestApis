### Installing Express:


`We can install it with npm. Make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed.`

`Step 1: Creating a directory for our project and make that our working directory.`
$ mkdir backend
$ cd backend 

`Step 2: To create a nodejs application, because our express server will work inside the node application. Using npm init command to create a package.json file for our project`
$ npm init
This command describes all the dependencies of our project. The file will be updated when adding further Installing Express

1. Note: Use `npm init -y` for default initialization

Step 3: Now in your backend folder type the following command line
$ npm install express --save

Step 3: `Now install Express in the myapp directory and save it in the dependencies list. This Install necessary dependencies for our application. For example:`
$ npm install express.

Step 3: To install Express temporarily and not add it to the dependencies list:
$ npm install express --no-save

Step 4.  `Install node : npm i express nodemon`

Step 5 . `Install cors : npm install express cors --save`
